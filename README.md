# ProtoUX
An experimental, HTML-based wireframe and prototype framework for designers.

#Getting Started
##Designers
1.  Use the latest version of Chrome.
2.  Enable the experimental chrome flag: 
    chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features
3.  Download the ProtoUX.zip and extract into a directory of your choosing. Copy this directory path.
4.  Setup a localhost server for your OS.
5. Create your wireframes and prototype! Sublime and Notepad++ are great, free editors.

##Prototype Viewers
1.  Use the latest version of Chrome.
2.  Enable the experimental chrome flag: 
    chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features
3. Bug your designer for the URL to the prototype.

##Contributors
The primary purpose of ProtoUX is to enable designers of all skill levels to rapidly prototype by using as little JS as possible.

To accomplish this, it is important that:
1.  You shove all the JS under the hood in protoux.js
2.  Update the protoux-docs.html with any changes
