##Contributors
The primary purpose of ProtoUX is to enable designers of all skill levels to rapidly prototype by using as little JS as possible.

To accomplish this, web components, html imports, shadow DOM, and the like are used to build a "library" of interface elements. These elements, with all of the JS under the hood, enable quick prototype building with simple HTML/CSS structures.

When contributing in the building of compoennts, it is important that:
1.	You shove all the JS under the hood
2.	You update the protoux-docs.html with any changes/updates
